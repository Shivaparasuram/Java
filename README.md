# Java

A collection of Java projects, examples, and exercises demonstrating core Java concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. This repository contains small programs, utilities, and sample implementations intended for learning, experimentation, and quick reference.

## Summary
This repository showcases idiomatic Java code across a variety of topics — such as object-oriented design, data structures & algorithms, concurrency, file I/O, networking, and common utilities. Each directory typically contains a self-contained example or project with source code, basic instructions to build and run, and (where applicable) tests.

## Highlights
- Clear, small examples suitable for learning and teaching Java fundamentals
- Algorithm and data-structure implementations for practice and reference
- Practical utilities and sample applications demonstrating real-world techniques
- Tests and example inputs where available
