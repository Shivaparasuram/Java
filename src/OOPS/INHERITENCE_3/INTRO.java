multi level ----   2  parent to 2 or more child  A-B-C
hierarchy   ----   1 parent multiple child class   A-B A-C
hybrid      ----   combo of types of inheritance
Multiple    ----   2 parents for 1 child    not supported in Java           **********************
                   leads to ambiguity and complexity in code management
                   Instead of multiple inheritance, Java uses interfaces.
